JARED:
* TODO Makefile
  - [ ] fix it so that it actually compiles

DANIEL:
* TODO Functors:
  - [X] integrate changes from functors.[ch] and node.[ch] in tmp
  - [ ] take functor.c in tmp, and use similar things to form test
    cases
  - [ ] make two functor templates, one for correction and one for
	scoring.  
  - [ ] go through somapfunctors.cpp and look at what Jared wrote.
	Think about if any of it will have to change given the two functor
	classes. 
* TODO Nodes:
  - [ ] give CORRECT the distance as an argument
